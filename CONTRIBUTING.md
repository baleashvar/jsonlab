# Contributing to JSONLab

Hi! I'm **Baleashvar**. I built JSONLab to help developers with fast, private JSON processing that runs entirely in your browser. If you want to help make it even better, I'd love your contribution! 🚀

## 🎯 Quick Start for Contributors

**New to open source?** Perfect! JSONLab is beginner-friendly.

1. **Fork** this repo
2. **Pick** a [Good First Issue](https://github.com/baleashvar/jsonlab/labels/good%20first%20issue)
3. **Code** your solution
4. **Submit** a Pull Request

That's it! I'll review and help you get it merged.

## 🛠️ Development Setup

JSONLab is a **static site** - no complex build process!

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jsonlab.git
cd jsonlab

# Install dependencies (optional, for linting)
npm install

# Start development
npm run dev
# or just open index.html in browser
```
